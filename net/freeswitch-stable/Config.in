config FS_STABLE_WITH_DEBUG
	bool "Compile with debug information"
	default n
	help
	  Enable extra debug codepaths, like asserts and extra output. If you
	  want to get meaningful backtraces see
	  https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/debugging for starting points.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_FREETYPE
	bool "Compile with FreeType support"
	default n
	help
	  Add FreeType support to FreeSWITCH

config FS_STABLE_WITH_LIBEDIT
	bool "Compile with libedit support"
	default y
	help
	  Compile with libedit support to enable command-line history editing
	  and curses functionality. Of course this feels nicer when interacting
	  with FreeSWITCH (without it it doesn't feel very interactive at all),
	  but it adds additional dependencies (libedit, libncursesw, terminfo).
