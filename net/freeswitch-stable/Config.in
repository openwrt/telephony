config FS_STABLE_WITH_DEBUG
	bool "Compile with debug information"
	default n
	help
	  Enable extra debug codepaths, like asserts and extra output. If you
	  want to get meaningful backtraces see
	  https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/debugging for starting points.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_FREETYPE
	bool "Compile with FreeType support"
	default y if x86_64
	help
	  Add FreeType support to FreeSWITCH

config FS_STABLE_WITH_LIBEDIT
	bool "Compile with libedit support"
	default y
	help
	  Compile with libedit support to enable command-line history editing
	  and curses functionality. Of course this feels nicer when interacting
	  with FreeSWITCH (without it it doesn't feel very interactive at all),
	  but it adds additional dependencies (libedit, libncursesw, terminfo).

config FS_STABLE_WITH_LIBYUV
	bool "Compile with libyuv support"
	default y if x86_64
	help
	  Add libyuv support to FreeSWITCH

config FS_STABLE_WITH_ODBC
	bool "Compile with ODBC support"
	default y if x86_64
	help
	  Enable ODBC support.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_PGSQL
	bool "Compile with PGSQL support"
	default y if x86_64
	help
	  Enable PostgreSQL support.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_PNG
	bool "Compile with PNG support"
	default y if x86_64
	help
	  Add PNG support to FreeSWITCH

config FS_STABLE_WITH_SRTP
	bool "Compile with SRTP support"
	default y
	help
	  Compile with SRTP support.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_V8
	bool "Compile with V8 support"
	depends on arm||i386||mipsel||x86_64
	default y if x86_64
	help
	  The sole purpose of this symbol is to prevent mod_v8 from being built
	  by the build bots. Currently the only exception is x86_64. The build is
	  time-consuming and the module is quite large, making it an unlikely
	  choice for devices with limited resources.

	  If you want mod_v8 to become available, select 'y'.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_V8_SNAPSHOT
	bool "Include heap snapshot"
	depends on FS_STABLE_WITH_V8
	default n
	help
	  V8 can be built with a heap snapshot for faster initialization. Default
	  is 'n' because of seemingly random segmentation faults observed when
	  generating the snapshot.

	  Only select 'y' if you know what you are doing.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_VPX
	bool "Compile with VPx support"
	depends on FS_STABLE_WITH_LIBYUV
	default y if x86_64
	help
	  Compile with VPx video codec support

config FS_STABLE_WITH_ZRTP
	bool "Compile with ZRTP support"
	depends on aarch64||aarch64_be||arm||armeb||i386||mips||mips64||mips64el||mipsel||powerpc||powerpc64||powerpcle||sparc||x86_64
	default y if x86_64
	help
	  Compile with ZRTP support.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_MODCONF
	bool "Include module examples"
	default y if x86_64
	help
	  Some modules include examples in their source directory, e.g. xml
	  snippets. Select y to include them.
