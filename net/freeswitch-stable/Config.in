config FS_STABLE_WITH_DEBUG
	bool "Compile with debug information"
	default n
	help
	  Enable extra debug codepaths, like asserts and extra output. If you
	  want to get meaningful backtraces see
	  https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/debugging for starting points.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_LIBEDIT
	bool "Compile with libedit support"
	default y
	help
	  Compile with libedit support to enable command-line history editing
	  and curses functionality. Of course this feels nicer when interacting
	  with FreeSWITCH (without it it doesn't feel very interactive at all),
	  but it adds additional dependencies (libedit, libncursesw, terminfo).

config FS_STABLE_WITH_ODBC
	bool "Compile with ODBC support"
	default n
	help
	  Enable ODBC support.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_PGSQL
	bool "Compile with PGSQL support"
	default n
	help
	  Enable PostgreSQL support.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_SRTP
	bool "Enable SRTP"
	default y
	help
	  Compile with SRTP support.

config FS_STABLE_WITH_ZRTP
	bool "Enable ZRTP"
	default n
	help
	  Compile with ZRTP support.
