  config FS_STABLE_WITH_LIBEDIT
    bool "Compile with libedit support"
    default n
    help

      Compile with libedit support to enable command-line history editing and
      curses functionality. Of course this feels nicer when interacting with
      FreeSWITCH (without it it doesn't feel very interactive at all), but it
      adds additional dependencies (libedit, libncursesw, terminfo).

  config FS_STABLE_WITH_ODBC
    bool "Compile with ODBC support"
    default n
    help
        Enable ODBC support.

  config FS_STABLE_WITH_PGSQL
    bool "Compile with PGSQL support"
    default n
    help
        Enable PostgreSQL support.

  config FS_STABLE_WITH_SRTP
    bool "Enable SRTP"
    default y
    help
        Compile with SRTP support.

  config FS_STABLE_WITH_ZRTP
    bool "Enable ZRTP"
    default y
    help
	Compile with ZRTP support.
